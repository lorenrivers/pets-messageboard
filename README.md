Project description:
The projects aim is to create an interactive message board web app where users can create posts with usernames and post messages about their pets. We wanted to integrate upvote and 
downvote functionality as well as a comments section. We wanted each post to be saved on the page and alllow other users to comment under any given post.

User stories and problem domain:
As a user, I want to create and submit a post through a form with my username and see it displayed on the page.
As a user, I want to be able to view a list of posts that have been submitted by other users, which were stored in a database.
As a user, I want the app to be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
As a user, I want to be able to leave a comment under each post with my username and a message. 
As a user, I want to be able to click a button to either add an upvote/ downvote to that post.
